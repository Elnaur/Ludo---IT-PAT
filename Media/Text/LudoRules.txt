Rules:
1. Two, three or four players can play.

2. At the start of the game all four of a player's
   tokens are staged in their yard.

3. The players take turns clockwise rolling the 
   dice. 

4. If a player throws a six, a token can be moved 
   from its home to the gametrack and the player 
   gets another throw.

5. Once a token has been placed in the gametrack
   it can be moved according to the throw of the
   dice. If a player has more than one tokens on 
   the gametrack, the player can chose which one 
   to move.

6. If the token of a player lands on the same 
   block as the token of another player, the 
   token on which was landed moves back to their
   yard.

7. The tokens move once around the game track and
   then up towards the centre of the board, their
   home. The aim is to get all four tokens home
   first.
